                <br>so does it write anything?</br>
                <p>In this project we are going to make our first webpage, While doing this we have to find out what the best text editor is.</p>
                <p>I chose VSCode (Visual Studio code) for my text editor, reason for that is, it has shortcuts and tools for all programming languages that I would need.</br>
                <br>A big factor for me is that I can just login with my github account and have all my projects saved and ready from anywhere.</br>
