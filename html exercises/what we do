                <p>In this project we are going to make our first webpage, While doing this we have to find out what the best text editor is.<br>
                   I chose VSCode (Visual Studio code) for my text editor, reason for that is, it has shortcuts and tools for all programming languages that I would need.<br>
                   A big factor for me is that I can just login with my github account and have all my projects saved and ready from anywhere.</p>
